## User Story
1. As a User, I want to be able to submit a support ticket w/name, email, description -- POST
2. As a User, I should receive emails on ticket creation and status update (console log)
3. As an Admin, I should be able to view all tickets on the admin page -- GET
4. As an Admin, I want to be able to update the status of each ticket -- PATCH
5. As an Admin, I want to be able to respond to each ticket -- PATCH/POST/PUT

Schema:
-Ticket object: issue/response (1 to many), ticket status (string) 
-Ticket issue/response object: description (string)

Only 3 statuses, "new", "in progress", "resolved" -- implied oldest "Ticket issue/response object" was "new", everything else is "in progress" unless ticket is "resolved" (last is "resolved"). Could also have moved the status into the "Ticket issue/response object" to account for more detailed statuses past the 3.


##
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
